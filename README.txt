This mod replaces the French R35 with a Romanian modification, known as the Carul de Lupta R35 Modernizat, which fitted the turret and gun of an early model of the Russian T-26. Essentially, this can be thought of as a proof-of-concept for their later modification of the R35, which repurposed it to a tank destroyer, which mounted 45mm from the T-26 in a modified version of the R35's turret, known as the Vânatorul de Care R35.
